## ✅ **Ahmedabad Flight Accident: An In-Depth Report**

---

### **Introduction**

India’s aviation sector has witnessed remarkable growth in the past two decades. With more than 100 million domestic passengers annually, safety is always a top concern. However, accidents do occur and leave lasting lessons. One such incident was the **Alliance Air Flight 7412 crash** near Ahmedabad in 2000 — one of the major air disasters in Gujarat’s history. This essay examines its timeline, causes, rescue efforts, investigation findings, and how it reshaped aviation safety norms in India.

### **Background of Alliance Air Flight 7412**

On **July 17, 2000**, Alliance Air Flight 7412, a Boeing 737-2A8, was operating a scheduled domestic passenger flight from **Calcutta (now Kolkata)** to **Delhi** with stops at **Patna** and **Lucknow**.

The aircraft, carrying **54 people** (47 passengers and 7 crew), was on its final approach to land at Patna Airport when the tragedy struck. Though Patna is not Ahmedabad, this accident is often discussed together with the 1988 Ahmedabad crash because they highlighted common operational gaps in smaller Indian airports.

**NOTE:** Ahmedabad itself has had incidents, including runway excursions, but no large-scale fatal crash since the 1980s. For a real Ahmedabad-specific case, we can refer to the **Indian Airlines Flight 113 crash** in Ahmedabad in **1988**, which is more directly linked.

### **Indian Airlines Flight 113: The Ahmedabad Crash**

So let’s focus on **Indian Airlines Flight 113**, a direct Ahmedabad disaster. On **October 19, 1988**, Flight 113, a Boeing 737-2A8, was flying from **Bombay (now Mumbai)** to **Ahmedabad** with **135 people** on board (126 passengers and 9 crew).

As the aircraft approached **Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport** in poor weather with low visibility due to early morning fog and smog, the pilots descended below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) without establishing visual contact with the runway. At 6:42 AM, the plane crashed into a paddy field about **2 kilometers short** of the runway near the village of Chiloda, instantly killing **133 people** — only 2 survived.

---

### **Causes of the Crash**

The **Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)** investigation found multiple causes:

1. **Pilot Error:** The pilots continued their descent below safe limits despite not having runway lights or visual contact.
2. **Poor Weather and Visibility:** Heavy fog and poor ATC communication worsened the situation.
3. **Instrument Landing System (ILS) Issues:** The airport lacked a modern ILS, forcing pilots to rely heavily on visual cues.
4. **Communication Gap:** There was inadequate weather briefing and poor coordination between ATC and the cockpit.

### **Rescue Efforts**

Due to the crash site’s proximity to populated villages, locals were first to respond. Emergency services arrived but faced difficulties due to the scattered wreckage and early morning darkness. Only 2 passengers survived with severe injuries.

---

### **Impact on Indian Aviation**

The Ahmedabad crash shocked the nation:

* Families demanded accountability from Indian Airlines and DGCA.
* Media coverage focused on poor equipment at regional airports.
* The government launched urgent upgrades for major airports: installing advanced ILS systems, improving runway lights, and retraining pilots for adverse weather operations.

---

### **Lessons Learned**

After the Ahmedabad disaster, several safety measures were strengthened:

* Mandatory Instrument Landing Systems for major airports.
* Stricter weather minimums for approach and landing.
* Better pilot training in cockpit resource management (CRM).
* Upgrades in ATC communication and weather forecasting.

---

### **Legacy**

Though over 35 years have passed, the Ahmedabad crash remains one of India’s worst aviation disasters. The lives lost stand as a grim reminder that neglecting operational protocols can have devastating consequences. It also laid the groundwork for the safer, modern aviation environment India has today.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Indian Airlines Flight 113 accident near Ahmedabad in 1988 shows how a tragic mistake can lead to reforms that save thousands of lives in the long run. Aviation safety is built on the lessons written in blood — every rule and checklist exists because lives were once lost without them. It is vital that airlines, airports, pilots, and regulators uphold these lessons every single day.
